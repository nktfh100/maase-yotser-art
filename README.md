## Deployment ðŸš€

How I chose to deploy this project:

* Backend: [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) - Cloud platform to easily deploy apps.

* Frontend: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - Serverless web app hosting platform.

* Database: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) - Serverless MySQL database service.

* Images Hosting: [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces) - S3 compatible object storage with CDN support.

* Analytics: [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)

I chose this deployment stack because it makes deploying easy using GitHub as the one source of truth. I simply push changes to GitHub to trigger the deployment process.

In addition, both PlanetScale and Vercel offer generous free tiers :)
